# Project 1: Triple Peaks Library

The Triple Peaks Library webpage is the second project in the Software Engineering
program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on a design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Vertical stacking with z-index
- A CSS Form
- CSS Animation with keyframes and utilizing transform
- A flat BEM file structure

### Plans for improvement

There are a few things that I could plan on improving for this project some of them include:

- A smoother transition when clicking on the navigation links to each section
- A more tailored and styled navigation menu
- A sticky navigation menu
- Translucent 'card' with gradient behind the form for further styling
- More expressive animations in the about section, maybe other spheres floating around the larger sphere to fill empty space
